# Backrooms-Generator
v 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1

Generates pseudo-infinite backrooms mazes.
Extremely broken, turn around and walk through the ceiling to start.
Enjoy the chunk loading.
BUT IT WORKS.
Almost a really stable codebase, just needs some chunk threading.

But you can play it.
I didn't add sound effects yet or anything.
Please help it is 3 AM.
